# Segmenter1
A simple segmentation tool for SparkPost stored lists

This is an example of how a SparkPost user can leverage the exisitng tools and API to create a segmentation system for thier data.
It assumes you have an existing SparkPost account of some flavour and have generated at least one API key that has access to templates, lists, and transmissions.
Ths sample is all in PHP and requires some HTTP platform to run in.  The test for demo purposes was done with Apache2 using PHP 5.6.27.
